# Cyber Triage Collector Script

This batch script automates the process of collecting digital forensic data using Cyber Triage. It creates a directory for Cyber Triage output, downloads the Cyber Triage Collector, fetches an S3 configuration file specific to the case, and runs Cyber Triage to upload the collected data to an S3 Bucket created for the case.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following:

- Windows operating system.
- The `curl` command-line tool installed.

## Usage

1. Copy and paste the script into a text editor.

2. Save the script with a `.bat` extension, for example, `cyber_triage_collector.bat`.

3. Open Command Prompt with administrative privileges.

4. Navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

5. Run the script by typing its name, for example:

   ```shell
   cyber_triage_collector.bat
   ```

6. The script will perform the following actions:

   - Create a directory for Cyber Triage output at `C:\windows\temp\_ct`.

   - Download the Cyber Triage Collector executable from Dropbox and save it in the output directory.

   - Download an S3 configuration file specific to the case from Dropbox and save it in the output directory.

   - Run Cyber Triage, specifying the output directory and the S3 configuration file for data collection and upload.

## Customization

You can customize the script by modifying the following lines:

- Modify the directory path where the output will be stored:

   ```batch
   mkdir C:\windows\temp\_ct
   ```

- Modify the URL for downloading the Cyber Triage Collector:

   ```batch
   curl -L -o c:\windows\temp\_ct\cyber_triage_collector.exe "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/g221zanjz41f5alfw7wlr/CyberTriageCollector.exe?rlkey=3dlnqflj589krv6gipk0he96u&dl=1"
   ```

- Modify the URL for downloading the S3 configuration file:

   ```batch
   curl -L -o C:\windows\temp\_ct\s3config.conf "https://uc6c6391ddf5e5c239a37a2ff0ea.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/cd/0/inline/CMCJTdHJDy7hLWzMFxtWQIYe6fUcAk1gzmzIZ_0EBHSH5h_wGZVJuoQH0LDzCV1AQYVSWze-TESO8xwn-e7b39kKZyiPJyy51HjjsMOrPiRRj469mddl7YLtSZv192FQmqA8XCOAZwg3YcuVK7yTzGZ5/file?dl=1#"
